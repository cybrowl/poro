### Feasibility and Implementation
- **Deposit ICP (Any Amount)**: Users send ICP to your canister's wallet address (generated uniquely per user via ICP's Principal ID for tracking). No minimumâ€”canister accepts any amount, converts excess to ckUSDC reserve. Use ICP's ledger canister for secure, low-fee (~$0.0001) transfers.

- **Convert ICP to ckUSDC**: On-chain via ICP DEX like Sonic or ICPSwap (integrated with ckUSDC since 2024). Fee ~0.3% swap + negligible ICP tx. Automate in canister using HTTPS outcalls to DEX APIs or direct ledger calls.

- **Pay $4 in ckUSDC for Service**: Deduct $4 equivalent from ckUSDC balance (using ICP's token ledger); activate sub if sufficient. Excess stays as credit for future months.

- **Weekly Convert ckUSDC to USDC**: Burn ckUSDC via ICP's Ethereum integration (ckUSDC Sepolia bridge) to get USDC on Ethereum/L2 (~$1-5 fee per batch, 0.1-0.5% effective for volume). Deposit to Coinbase via wallet transfer (free).

- **Withdraw USD for API Costs**: From Coinbase, convert USDC to USD (free, 1:1) and withdraw via ACH (free for business).

- **Security/Volatility**: Use multi-sig canisters for deposits; auto-convert to minimize ICP exposure (weekly mitigates short-term fluctuations).
