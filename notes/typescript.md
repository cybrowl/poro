No, you don't have to convert a TypeScript-based project to JavaScript to use it—you can absolutely integrate or adopt one as-is in your SvelteKit setup (or similar environments) by ensuring TypeScript support is enabled. Here's a clear breakdown to help you decide:

### Why You Can Use TS Projects Without Conversion
- **SvelteKit Native Support**: SvelteKit (and Vite underneath) fully supports TypeScript out of the box. If the project uses `.ts` files, type annotations, or TS-specific features (e.g., interfaces, generics), it will build and run fine as long as you have the necessary dependencies installed. Your current "poro" project was originally set up with partial TS compatibility (e.g., via `jsconfig.json` extending `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`), so re-enabling it is straightforward.
- **No Forced Conversion**: Conversion (e.g., renaming `.ts` to `.js` and stripping types) is only needed if you explicitly want a JS-only codebase (e.g., to avoid TS deps or for simpler maintenance). But this loses benefits like type safety, better autocompletion in editors, and error catching during development.
- **Integration Scenarios**:
  - **Forking/Adopting a TS Project**: Clone it, install deps (including `typescript`), and run as usual. Your JS-only code can coexist with TS files—SvelteKit transpiles TS to JS during build.
  - **Importing TS Components/Libs**: If pulling in TS code (e.g., via npm packages or copying files), add TS support to your project (see below). Tools like ESLint and Prettier will handle mixed JS/TS if configured.
  - **No Runtime Impact**: TS is a compile-time tool; the output is plain JS, so your deployed app (e.g., via `dfx deploy`) remains JS regardless.

### How to Enable TS in Your Current Project (If Needed)
If you want to use a TS-based project without converting it:
1. **Add Back Dependencies**: In your `package.json`, reinstall TS-related devDeps (removed earlier):
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     // ... existing ones ...
     "typescript": "^5.9.2",
     "svelte-check": "^4.3.0"
   }
   ```
   Run `npm install` to add them.

2. **Restore Scripts**: Add back TS-checking scripts to `package.json` for validation:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     // ... existing ones ...
     "check": "svelte-kit sync && svelte-check --tsconfig ./jsconfig.json",
     "check:watch": "svelte-kit sync && svelte-check --tsconfig ./jsconfig.json --watch"
   }
   ```

3. **Update `jsconfig.json`** (or rename to `tsconfig.json` for full TS):
   - Keep or adjust your existing one to enable JS checking if desired (set `"checkJs": true` for type hints in JS files without full TS).
   - Run `npm run check` to validate.

4. **Editor Setup**: In VS Code, install the Svelte extension—it'll use the config for intellisense. No changes needed for build/deploy.

### When/How to Convert to JS (If You Prefer)
If you insist on a pure JS setup (e.g., to minimize deps or avoid learning TS):
- **Manual Conversion**:
  1. Rename `.ts` files to `.js`.
  2. Remove type annotations (e.g., `: string` becomes nothing).
  3. Replace TS-specific syntax (e.g., interfaces → plain objects; enums → constants).
  4. Update imports/exports accordingly.
- **Tools for Automation**: Use `tsc --noEmit` to check for errors, then tools like `ts-to-js` or Babel plugins for bulk conversion (install via npm if needed).
- **Drawbacks**: Loses type safety, which can lead to runtime errors. Only do this if the TS project is small or you're comfortable debugging JS.
