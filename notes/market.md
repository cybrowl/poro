# Poro Business Plan

## Executive Summary
Poro is a decentralized unified API platform on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for accessing diverse AI models, leveraging USDC for payments to prioritize user privacy via end-to-end encryption and on-chain execution. It targets the 1.3 billion unbanked adults worldwide in emerging markets with borderless stablecoin payments, bypassing credit cards, while empowering developers to build Web3 dApps integrating AI into DeFi, DAOs, and more.

This plan evaluates demand in the decentralized AI market (valued at $680–700 million in 2025, growing to $4.33 billion by 2034 at 23% CAGR), key success factors, profit projections (with a $4/month subscription paid in USDC for unlimited open-source model access and rate-limited proprietary models, 89%+ margins after fees), and a strategy harnessing ICP's chain-key cryptography for secure, scalable AI.

## Overview
Poro addresses barriers in AI access by providing a unified API for LLMs and image generators via ICP's decentralized infrastructure, with a $4/month subscription (paid in USDC) for unlimited access to open-source models (e.g., Llama 3.1, Mistral) and rate-limited proprietary models (e.g., 500 queries/month to GPT-4o/Claude). Features include end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, on-chain smart agents for dApps, and seamless integration for Web3 ecosystems like DeFi/DAOs. The project is open-source on Github with an X account (@poro_app).

## 1. Demand for Poro
Demand is fueled by AI proxy growth and decentralized needs:

- **AI Proxy Market**: AI API market at ~$44 billion in 2025; proxies like Perplexity ($18 billion valuation, $148 million ARR) and OpenRouter ($500 million valuation) show traction. Poe focuses on consumer models with subscription revenue.
- **Decentralized AI Growth**: $680–700 million in 2025 (to $4.33 billion by 2034, 23% CAGR); blockchain AI at ~$0.7 billion in 2025.
- **Unbanked Access**: 1.3 billion adults unbanked; $4 sub in USDC appeals to low-income markets.
- **Web3 Integration**: ICP discussions on subscriptions (e.g., Dmail's SubHub, Caffeine AI payments).
- **Target**: Developers/unbanked; $4 undercuts $20 benchmarks.

**Conclusion**: High demand for affordable AI; $4 sub positions Poro as disruptor.

## 2. Key Considerations for Success

### A. Operational Considerations
- **Development and Features**: ICP-based; unlimited open-source models, rate-limited proprietary. Integrate kimi-k2/deepseek.
- **UI/UX Design**: Simple for unbanked; wallet onboarding for USDC payments.
- **Security and Scalability**: Chain-key; audits.

### B. Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA; ZK proofs.
- **Regulatory**: Crypto volatility; ICP Swiss base.
- **Safety**: Rate limits prevent abuse.

### C. Market and Competition
- **Differentiation**: Low-cost/open-source vs. $20 subs; Web3 focus.
- **Marketing**: Target unbanked via X/ICP communities.
- **Retention**: Value at $4; premium upsells.

### D. Cultural and Social Factors
- **Barriers**: Crypto education; simple UX.
- **Global Appeal**: $4 affordable for emerging markets.
- **Inclusivity**: Bias-free open-source.

### E. Financial Considerations
- **Pricing**: $4/month in USDC; undercuts benchmarks ($20 average).
- **Revenue Model**: Subscriptions; 89%+ margins after 1% payment fees (e.g., Coinbase Commerce) and low operational costs.
- **Fees**: ICP minimal; 1% on receipts for processing tools.

### Key Risks
- **Adoption**: $4 low value perception; crypto friction.
- **Competition**: Undercutting risks quality race.
- **Churn**: If open-source lags.
- **Volatility**: USDC stability mitigates some risks.
