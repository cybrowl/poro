### Main Features of Poro

Poro is a decentralized unified API platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), designed to make AI models accessible, private, and integrated with Web3 ecosystems. Below, I'll outline its core features based on the project's overview and capabilities:

1. **Unified API for AI Models**: Provides a single endpoint to access a wide range of AI models, including large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude, as well as image generators. This simplifies integration for developers building dApps.

2. **Affordable Subscription Model**: $4/month paid in USDC, offering unlimited access to open-source models (e.g., Llama 3.1, Mistral Nemo) and rate-limited access to proprietary models (e.g., 500 queries/month to premium ones like GPT-4o or Claude). This undercuts competitors' $20/month plans while supporting unbanked users via stablecoin payments.

3. **Privacy-First Design**: End-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge proofs ensure user data sovereigntyâ€”queries and responses are processed securely on-chain, preventing centralized harvesting or third-party access.

4. **Borderless Payments for Unbanked**: Accepts USDC via Coinbase Commerce or direct wallet deposits, bypassing traditional banks/credit cards.

5. **Scalable and Secure Infrastructure**: Leverages ICP's chain-key cryptography for cross-chain bridges (e.g., ckUSDC) and low-cost operations.
